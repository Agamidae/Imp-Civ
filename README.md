How to install:

1. Download the code to your "mod" folder (Documents/Paradox Interactive/Imperator/mod)
2. Unzip it to a folder, rename the folder to "Imp-Civ"
3. Open it and move Imp-Civ.mod out to your "mod" folder
4. Enable the mod in the launcher


Things that need checking:
- character cultures
- a lot of old things remain, like on_actions
- religion conversion. I removed norse because it actually has a different name
